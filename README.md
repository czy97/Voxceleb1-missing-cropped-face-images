# Voxceleb1-missing-cropped-face-images
The audio data of voxceleb1 dataset can be downloaded [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html). The cropped images at 1 fps of each each recording in voxceleb1 dataset can be downloaded [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/CMBiometrics/)  
We find that the following recordings have no corresponding face images. And we download the videos of these recordings from the youtube and extracted face images at 1 fps and named each image in [original format](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/CMBiometrics/).
